# Development Notes

**Remember to activate the testing environment!**

Learn about Python environments!

Once you're done, you may **deactivate the environment**.

## TODO

1. Dockerize the project.
1. $question - record somebody asked something.
    1. Set reminder (May anybody answer {question.user}, please?)
    1. Store $question in database.
    1. Set reminder period in .env
    1. $answer
    1. Match $answer with $question -> move to #q&a channel
    1. Clean $question from database

1. Make encouragements case-insensitive.

1. Randomize greetings.

1. $meeting schedules a meeting: store it in db, publish it in #agenda channel, set reminder 30 min. ahead.

1. Clarify Amazon login: .pem file, fingerprint, etc.

  The authenticity of host 'ec2-52-28-48-82.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com (52.28.48.82)' can't be established.
  ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:DmKx0TxK+s3qS8WcOcUAtZLhJi0P4Id41lRHGMHEWHU.
  This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
      ~/.ssh/known_hosts:7: [hashed name]
      ~/.ssh/known_hosts:10: [hashed name]
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

1. Include some sort of dictionary to demonstrate the data structure.
  Article by Mustafa: <https://www.kaggle.com/code/mustafagerme/06-dictionaries-in-python>

1. Stop the bot. $stop command.
  It must close the database connection to make sure all data is recorded on disk.

1. DO NOT IMPLEMENT $stop command to stop [stop the instance].
  <https://aws.plainenglish.io/the-fear-of-boto3-how-to-stop-ec2-instances-using-python-f0339a8ec986>

Command is:

  ec2.Instance('{INSTANCE-ID}').stop()

Therefore, we need to get the instance name in the discord chat to be able to stop the bot. Log message uses it(?)

1. Create a non-admin user in AWS.
    1. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html> to change default user and password.

1. CONFIG

1. README
  Add functionality description.

-[deepl-python in GitHub](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-python)

1. Increase Security against MitM attacks: [(Optional) Get the instance fingerprint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html)
1. Store Servers where the bot is used. Keep track!
1. Alternative database

## sqlite3 database

CLI to SQLite3

<https://dzone.com/articles/use-returning-clause-to-avoid-unnecessary-sql-stat>

<https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/sqlite3.1.html>

Use `.schema tablename` to see the description of a table.
<https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-describe-table/>

Use `.help` and `.quit` for obvious commands.
Use `select * from tablename;` and other SQL commands, when needed.

Dates are stored as text, and may be retrieved in different ways.
<https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html>

Use sqlite3 from Python: <https://towardsdatascience.com/do-you-know-python-has-a-built-in-database-d553989c87bd>

## The Python Requirements File and How to Create it

Read <https://learnpython.com/blog/python-requirements-file/> but go first to the sections **How to Create Python Requirements File After Development** and **Best Practices for Using a Python Requirements File**.

Create the `requirements.txt` file from the `import`s of the `.py` files:

    ~/.local/bin/pipreqs --force .

    # check for missing dependencies in your python installation (not only in your project)
    python3 -m pip check

    # make sure all python modules are updated.
    # this is not an optimal solution. see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2720014/how-to-upgrade-all-python-packages-with-pip
    pip list --outdated | awk 'NR > 2 { print $1 }' | xargs -n1 pip install -U

It is also possible to upgrade everything with `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`.

Drop the first lines of a text file: <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/37790/how-do-i-delete-the-first-n-lines-of-an-ascii-file-using-shell-commands>

## Deploy in AWS

Following this procedure:<https://victormerino.medium.com/running-a-python-script-24-7-in-cloud-for-free-amazon-web-services-ec2-76af166ae4fb>

The step "We can access our instance using SSH using this command" does not work.

I use this to connect to the instance using ssh:<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html>

See file publicDNS.txt for instance setting details.

- The `requests` module is not built-in as explained in [ImportError: No module named requests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17309288/importerror-no-module-named-requests). It must be imported by using the following command:

- The discord module is not found.

  sudo apt install pythonpy
  pip install -U discord.py

- No module named 'dotenv'

  pip install python-dotenv
