## Deploy in AWS

Folling this procedure:<https://victormerino.medium.com/running-a-python-script-24-7-in-cloud-for-free-amazon-web-services-ec2-76af166ae4fb>

The step "We can access our instance using SSH using this command" does not work.

I use this to connect to the instance using ssh:<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html>

See file publicDNS.txt for instance setting details.
