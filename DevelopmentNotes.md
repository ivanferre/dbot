# Development Notes

**Remember to activate the testing environment!**

Learn about Python environments!

Once you're done, you may **deactivate the environment**.

## TODO

  if (ongoingStop & ({message.author} == ongoingStopUser)):
  UnboundLocalError: local variable 'ongoingStop' referenced before assignment

1. Test functions, param and globals.

- def myfunction()
- bool = myfunction()
- bool = myfunction() # uses global variable.

1. $stop command to stop [stop the instance].
  <https://aws.plainenglish.io/the-fear-of-boto3-how-to-stop-ec2-instances-using-python-f0339a8ec986>

Command is:

  ec2.Instance('{INSTANCE-ID}').stop()

Therefore, we need to get the instance name in the discord chat to be able to stop the bot. Log message uses it(?)

1. Create a non-admin user in AWS.
    1. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html> to change default user and password.

1. CONFIG

1. $help = list of bot commands

1. README
  Add functionality description.
1. Use database to store lists of words.
1. $question - record somebody asked something.
    1. Set reminder (May anybody answer {question.user}, please?)
    1. Store $question in database.
    1. Set reminder period in .env
    1. $answer
    1. Match $answer with $question -> move to #q&a channel
    1. Clean $question from database

1. $meeting schedules a meeting: store it in db, publish it in #agenda channel, set reminder 30 min. ahead.
1. $translate:LL str translates the string to language LL by calling (deepl|google) API.

1. Increase Security against MitM attacks: [(Optional) Get the instance fingerprint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html)
1. Store Servers where the bot is used. Keep track!
1. Alternative database

## Deploy in AWS

Following this procedure:<https://victormerino.medium.com/running-a-python-script-24-7-in-cloud-for-free-amazon-web-services-ec2-76af166ae4fb>

The step "We can access our instance using SSH using this command" does not work.

I use this to connect to the instance using ssh:<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html>

See file publicDNS.txt for instance setting details.

- The `requests` module is not built-in as explained in [ImportError: No module named requests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17309288/importerror-no-module-named-requests). It must be imported by using the following command:

    sudo apt-get install python3-requests

- The discord module is not found.

  sudo apt install pythonpy
  pip install -U discord.py

- No module named 'dotenv'

  pip install python-dotenv
